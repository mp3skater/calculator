> A simple calculator that uses call-arguments and a upn/rpn-backbone-system to calculate even more complex equations.

## Features

--> Info: This project was an interesting school-exercise (a simple rpn calculator) which I really liked and I'm now trying to convert a fully funktional not rpn-calculator ;)

**Added Features:**
- Rpn version with all files in one place (will be converted into full calculator when the time comes) [what is rpn?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)

- Makefile for the program

**In Future:**
- A full calculator with brackets, "Punkt vor Strich"(German), addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, floor division;

## How to use

To compile this program I'd recommend to use a linux distro with [gcc](https://www.gnu.org/software/gcc/), but you can also use [MinGW](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) for windows or an IDE like Vim/Emacs or VCS for Windows and MacOS.
The rules to compile the different Test-programs are in the makefile.
